Target Encoding

Replaces categorical values with the mean of the target variable for that category.
Useful for high-cardinality categorical features in regression/classification problems.
Risk: Can lead to data leakage if not applied correctly (e.g., using the whole dataset instead of only training data).
Polynomial Features

Creates new features by raising existing numerical features to different powers and combining them (e.g., squaring, cubing, interactions).
Helps capture non-linear relationships between variables and the target.
Used in models like polynomial regression and neural networks.
Binning (Discretization)

Converts continuous numerical features into categorical bins (e.g., age groups: 18-25, 26-35, etc.).
Reduces the impact of noise and helps models generalize better.
Common methods: Equal-width binning, equal-frequency binning, and clustering-based binning (e.g., k-means).
Time-Based Features

Extracts temporal information from time-series data (e.g., day of the week, month, season, lag features, rolling averages).
Helps models capture trends and periodic patterns.
Essential for forecasting and time-sensitive applications.
Clustering-Based Features

Groups similar data points using clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means) and assigns a cluster label as a new feature.
Captures hidden patterns and group structures in data.
Useful when there are no explicit categories but underlying groupings exist.
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Reduces dimensionality by transforming features into new, uncorrelated principal components.
Helps remove redundancy and noise while retaining most of the variance.
Improves model efficiency and prevents overfitting in high-dimensional data.
Feature Selection (Mutual Information & Other Methods)

Identifies the most relevant features based on their contribution to the target variable.
Methods include mutual information, correlation analysis, LASSO regularization, and tree-based feature importance.
Reduces overfitting and improves model interpretability.
Each of these techniques can significantly impact model performance depending on the dataset and problem type
